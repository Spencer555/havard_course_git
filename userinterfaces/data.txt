Single page applications

window - the entire browser
.innerWidth the size of user screen
.innerHeight the height of user screen

.scrollY - how many pixels far Y have u scrolled when u are at top of page its 0 
.scrollX - how many pixels far X have u scrolled when u are at top of page its 0 


scrollY + innerHeight + heightOfWindow would be equal to document.body.offsetHeight
